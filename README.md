# School and Hobby Projects

I will be creating folders and sub folders categorized by school projects and personal hobby projects in my Projects repository.



### Starting Information

All of these projects will be coded in Golang, Python, C++ or C#. I will also include my largest detailed projects on the 
front page for ease of access and showcase.

### Showcase

Showcase includes all myself proclaimed best projects that have been finished or currently progressing.

* **TextRPG created in Go** [TextRPG](https://github.com/ohhnate/Projects/blob/master/School/Go/CSCI%2020/textRPG.go)
* **Discord Bot created in Go** [DiscordBot](https://github.com/ohhnate/Projects/tree/master/Hobby)

## Running tests

Several of the projects in Go and C++ have test cases included. The Go projects are just utilizing the built in go test functions
while C++ projects will be using the catch2 library. 


## Contributions

Most of these projects are coded soley by me but a few have contributions by Derek Bergman and outside libraries which are noted as used.

Additionally, I am always up for collaboration on projects and am looking to learn. If you would like to work with me contact me
here on github or by email at: ohhnate@gmail.com
